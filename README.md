> Content-Based Filtering: Suggests books based on the content (e.g., genres, authors) of books the user has enjoyed in the past.

> User-Friendly Interface: Deployed using Streamlit for easy interaction.

# Technologies Used
> Python: Core programming language for development.

> Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

> NumPy: Numerical computing and operations.

> Scikit-Learn: Machine learning algorithms and evaluation.

> Surprise: A Python library for building and analyzing recommender systems.

> Streamlit (Optional): For deploying the recommendation system as a web application.
